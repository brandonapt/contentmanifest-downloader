# contentmanifest downloader  
*i should probably think of a better name*  
  
cmdownloader is a simple script to download all the files from a contentmanifest xml.
created to be used on the skylanders mobile games, so be wary if you're using it for something else  
  
how to use:
install node.js via their website (https://nodejs.org)  
download this repo  
open a command prompt in the same folder as this repo  
run "npm install"  
open the "download_urdat.js" file  
change around and add your urls, folders, and baseurls  
run "node download_urdat" in that command prompt
